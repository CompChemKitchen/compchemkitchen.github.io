Our third meeting, CCK-3, on Tuesday, July 12th, 2016, will be a little different: it will be a two-parter, CCK-3.1 and CCK-3.2:

The [Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC)](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/) has been hosting and distributing the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [for 50 years](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/News/csd50/), and its latest release, [CSD 2016](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-system/components/csd/), is the “world’s essential database of crystal structures, \[with\] over 800,000 entries”.

 **CCK-3.1**

*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">1:30-3:30 pm</span>*  
IT Teaching Laboratory (LG.02) of the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/contact_us), 24-29 St Giles’, Oxford, OX1 3LB:

Andrew Maloney &amp; Peter Wood (CCDC): **“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[CSD Python API](https://downloads.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/documentation/API/) Workshop and Hackathon</span>“**. (We are planning to provide hands-on access to the API, and since there are only 48 desktops, so you should make sure to book a ticket.)

[Register for CCK-3.1](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/comp-chem-kitchen-cck-31-tickets-25991302686).

 **CCK-3.2**

*<span style="text-decoration: underline;">5.00 – 6:00 pm</span>*  
Talks and refreshments/beer, will again be held in the Abbot’s Kitchen in the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QR:

- Andrew G. P. Maloney &amp; Peter Wood ([Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/)): “**Harnessing the power of the Cambridge Structural Database in your own way: the CSD Python API**“.
- <span class="message_body">Iva Pritisanac ([Andy Baldwin Group, ](http://research.chem.ox.ac.uk/andrew-baldwin.aspx)[Department of Chemistry](http://research.chem.ox.ac.uk/andrew-baldwin.aspx)): *Lightning Talk,* “**Novel application of graph algorithms in the analysis of NMR specta**“.</span>
- Laura Domicevica ([Biggin Group, Department of Biochemistry](http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/aspsite/index.asp?pageid=567)): *Lightning Talk,* “**LINTools: time-resolved graphical representation of ligand-protein interactions**“.
- Tim Dudgeon ([Informatics Matters](http://www.informaticsmatters.com/)): *Lightning Talk,* “**The Squonk Computational Notebook – making cheminformatics and comp chem accessible to normal people!**“.

[Register for CCK-3.2](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/comp-chem-kitchen-cck-32-tickets-25991250530).

If you have a 5-minute Lightning Talk you’d like to give, [get in touch](mailto:garrett.morris@stats.ox.ac.uk)!

Also, if you have some code you’d like demo, bring your laptop/mobile device.  
Refreshments will be provided, including beer. (Thank you to Prof. Phil Biggin and the *MRC Proximity to Discovery Fund* for supporting CCK.)
