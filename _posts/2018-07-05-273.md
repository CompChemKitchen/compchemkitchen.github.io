On behalf of the eCheminfo Network and Community of Practice, we would like to announce that the [eCheminfo Oxford 2018](http://www.echeminfo.com/events/echeminfo-oxford-2018) workshop is now open to [registrations](https://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?oeidk=a07efehzbmo9c2ea25c&oseq=&c=&ch=):

<http://www.echeminfo.com/events/echeminfo-oxford-2018>

It will be held 3-7 September, 2018, at [Diamond House, Harwell Science &amp; Innovation Campus, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 0DE, UK](https://goo.gl/maps/urJwGxUH6js).

In this one-week, hands-on workshop, leading modelling experts will introduce state-of-the-art and emerging modelling approaches and tools for all aspects of rational drug design and lead group work sessions, in which these tools will be applied on practical examples and case studies.

The case studies will be either provided by the participants (bring your own problems) or will be extracted from the keynote presentations.

In this way, the participants can directly apply their newly acquired knowledge to their own research, profit from specific advice by the experts and other participants and contribute to innovative approaches for all case studies.

The main topics covered by the workshop are:

- virtual screening
- ligand-based and structure-based drug design
- bio- and cheminformatics
- molecular dynamics simulation
- drug delivery modelling
- systems biology, and
- biotech drug design.

Early-bird reduced rates available until 1 August, 2018.

[Bursary Awards](http://www.echeminfo.com/bursary-awards) are available to support the registration costs of a selection of academic participants at the eCheminfo workshops.
