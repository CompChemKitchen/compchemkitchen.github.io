We are delighted to be returning with CCK-19 in the new seminar room of the Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin Building (a.k.a. the Phase II Biochemistry Department on Sherrington Road in the heart of the Science Area). We will be meeting jointly with our friends in Cambridge and Berlin via Zoom. We will have talks from Roger Sayle in Cambridge via Zoom, Matteo Ferla in Oxford, and Andrea Volkamer in Berlin, starting at 3:30 pm UK time. After the talks, ~5:15 pm, we will head over to The Royal Oak on Woodstock Road.
