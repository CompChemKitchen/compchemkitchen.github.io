<div>The next <span class="gmail-il">Comp</span> <span class="gmail-il">Chem</span> Kitchen for computational chemists, cheminformaticians, and molecular modelers will be on ***Thursday*** **January 12th, 2017, at 5.00 pm** in the Abbot’s Kitchen in the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory. Our main speaker will be: Dr Russell Viner from [Syngenta, UK](https://www.syngenta.co.uk/about-us), on *Structure-Based Design of a Novel Class of Herbicidal [HPPD Inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate_dioxygenase_inhibitor)*.

</div>Refreshments will be provided.

<div>We will also have a lightning talk:</div>- Anthony Bradley (Chemistry / DLS) *MMTF: Faster access to protein structure data from the PDB*

<div></div><div>Please get in touch to volunteer (or nominate) anyone (students, postdocs, professionals, PIs, Emeritus Professors) to give a “lightning talk” of up to 5 minutes. The talks usually resemble one of the following styles:</div>- an overview of computational chemistry in your research
- a (live!) demonstration of some software that you are developing or using
- a summary of a computational chemistry paper, method, or tool that you’ve seen recently

See previous CCK announcements for examples. Contact Garrett M. Morris, Richard Cooper, Phil Biggin or Rob Paton to volunteer.
