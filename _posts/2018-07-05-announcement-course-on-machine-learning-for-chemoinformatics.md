Dr Martyn Winn would like to announce the following course:

***Machine Learning for Chemoinformatics***  
Location: RAL, Harwell Campus  
Dates: 6th – 10th August 2018  
Registration fee: academic £150, commercial £1000

The course covers all of the major methods in machine learning for classification and regression, with examples taken from problems in chemoinformatics. It has been designed for data analysts working in the pharmaceutical industry, but would also be useful to chemists interested in advanced data analysis. The course includes practical examples using commonly available Python packages.
