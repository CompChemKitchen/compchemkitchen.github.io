(*From*: <u>Frank von Delft, DLS &amp; SGC</u>):

We are recruiting a software engineer (or scientific programmer, or geek-minded scientist, or scientifically-minded geek) to help us get a lot better at designing compounds from hits from crystallographic fragment screening.

The post is linked to the XChem facility at Diamond’s beamline I04-1, set up in partnership with the SGC-Oxford, which is now routinely hosting users every week, allowing them to find convincing fragment hits with a few days’ worth of experiments. In 2017, over 30 users measured over 35,000 crystals in academic and industrial XChem experiments.

To confront the next bottleneck, namely converting low potency fragments into high-potency compounds, we are setting up a suite of easily accessible computational tools that streamline the obvious yet surprisingly fiddly analyses by which to identify the most sensible follow-up compounds that are easy to make or procure.

The (initially) two-year post will, in a team of three and depending on interests, build infrastructure, harden existing algorithms or help evolve new ones, do web interface design, or any combination of the above.

The project is seeding a nascent effort, for now aspirationally code-named CCP-CMC (CompMedChem, <http://www.ccp-cmc.org/>), to bring the awesome collaborative ethos of CCP4 and other MX tools to computational medicinal chemistry.
