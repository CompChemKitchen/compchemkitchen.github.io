We all had a lot of fun at our first CCK Hackathon, and our groups explored some very cool ideas using Python, RDKit, the CSD Python API, and CCDC tools such as IsoStar and SuperStar during the day. We came together afterwards, to hear Andrew Moloney from CCDC talk about *“Can we design drugs like we design airplanes? – The ADDoPT Project and the CCDC”*, and to see [the fruits of our labors](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10ed_xR_Fw4dtj203QbUkv4B_E2M6cdEf7ngB20aZZ6M/edit?usp=sharing) with a series of Lightning Talks summarizing each group’s work. The winners and runners-up received delicious prizes: boxes of chocolates.
