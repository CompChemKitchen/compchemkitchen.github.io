*Announcement forwarded on behalf of Prof. Jotun Hein &lt;<hein@stats.ox.ac.uk>&gt;, Chair of Bioinformatics, Department of Statistics:*

**Mathematical Chemistry and ChemoInformatics**

Would you like an introduction to mathematical chemistry based on the material from a recent book? Then you may want to come to the talk Monday 7th November 2-4 PM in IT Teaching Room, [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/contact_us/how_to_get_to_the_department).

The talk is given by Jotun Hein and William Kurdahl from the science book discussion club.

The book covers the combinatorics of molecules (especially Polya-Counting), their embedding in 3D Euclidian Space, Chirality, Stereoisomers and a series of application using the program MOLGEN. We are motived to study this book since William is working on models of origin life involving small molecules, but it is obvious that the field could be a rich source of statistical problems to work on.
