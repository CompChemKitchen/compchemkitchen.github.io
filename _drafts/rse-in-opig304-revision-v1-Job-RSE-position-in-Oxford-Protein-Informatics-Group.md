Applications are invited for the post of Research Software Engineer within the Oxford Protein Informatics Group, <http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/> (OPIG).

OPIG has developed a large number of world leading computational tools primarily in immunoinformatics which have proved to be of high interest to several pharmaceutical companies. These tools are open source and freely available to all users, academic and commercial. This open strategy has meant that the user base for the tools is broad both within academia and industry. Several of these tools have been taken in-house by pharmaceutical companies. This role is part of the team that supports these companies with deployment, maintenance, future developments, and integration with their own in-house systems and requirements.

Alongside working with the pharmaceutical companies, the postholder will carry out research and develop novel methodologies in at least one of the areas of research in OPIG.

This exciting position is unique within the University and will provide an unrivalled and privileged opportunity to interact directly with a highly productive academic group and many pharmaceutical companies.
