[Oxford Drug Design](https://www.oxforddrugdesign.com/index.html) is a unique biotechnology company. Supported by a proprietary set of computational chemistry methods developed in-house over the past 15 years, we are discovering new antibiotics to address the urgent threat of multi-drug resistant infections. Following success in obtaining funding from Innovate UK, the UKâ€™s Innovation agency, we are expanding our computer-aided drug design (CADD) team.

Your Role:

- Develop and validate novel CADD methodology in the areas of machine learning, statistical methods, chemogenomics and computational chemistry, working in a multidisciplinary team of internal and external colleagues, and be a key contributor to their success.
- Use a diverse array of computational technology to devise hypotheses for structure-activity relationships and compounds to test these hypotheses, focused on our antibiotic drug discovery portfolio.
- Maintain and build our internal cheminformatics databases and search technologies.
- Maintain awareness of the latest technologies and developments in CADD and project areas.
- Maintain an internal and external scientific presence by authoring significant scientific presentations and publications.

Who you are:

You will hold a PhD (or equivalent experience) in computer science, machine learning, computational chemistry, or a related field. Industry experience would be an advantage. You are expected to have a high degree of independence and self-motivation. Ideally, your background would include some of the following:

- Expertise in machine learning and other statistical approaches to data analysis and model generation.
- Expertise in scientific computing, and good programming skills (Python, C++ and Java skills are particularly relevant).
- Expertise in using cheminformatics techniques and relational databases.
- Knowledge of computational chemistry and medicinal chemistry concepts is an advantage.
- Very good written and verbal communication skills.

Please note that candidates must be eligible and able to work in the UK. Please include details of your eligibility with your application.

To apply, please send a CV and covering letter by 23 April-2019, quoting reference CC19-1, to: [contactus@oxforddrugdesign.com](mailto://contactus@oxforddrugdesign.com)
