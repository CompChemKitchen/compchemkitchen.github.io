***TL;DR: CCK-16**, the next in our series of meetings for computational chemists, cheminformaticians, and molecular modelers, will be on Thursday, October 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019, at 5:00 pm in the [Seminar Room, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU](https://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/contact#collapse810401). Free [CCK-16 tickets](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/comp-chem-kitchen-cck-16-tickets-74116126329) are available.*

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Please join us for our next **“Comp Chem Kitchen”, CCK-16**, at 5-6 pm on *Thursday,* October 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019, in the [Seminar Room, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QU](https://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/contact#collapse810401)*.* We are very pleased to announce **Dr Paulo Tosco** from Cresset, UK, will be speaking:

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized">![](https://compchemkitchen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1.png)<figcaption>*Dr Paulo Tosco*</figcaption></figure></div>*[Dr Paulo Tosco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paolo-tosco-67a75794/) ([Cresset](https://www.cresset-group.com), UK):* **“Design in 2D, Model in 3D: Live 3D Pose Generation from 2D Sketches”**

How nice would it be to be able to draw a molecule in your favourite 2D sketcher, and see in real time how its 3D electrostatic potential looks like, what interactions it makes in the active site, how its shape and electrostatics compare to a known active? This is why we decided to build from ground up a new molecular design platform around this engaging idea. As we started fleshing out the details of the *Grow3D* algorithm, a number of obvious and more subtle gotchas emerged.

In this talk I will illustrate how we addressed these challenges, and I will also give an overview of the integration of *Grow3D* in the context of our web-based molecular design platform, showing its effectiveness in bridging the gap between 2D and 3D methods.

 *Dr Paolo Tosco joined Cresset in 2014 after being an Assistant Professor at the University of Turin, Italy. A medicinal chemist by background, after completing his PhD in Drug Chemistry his main focus became computational chemistry, with a particular interest in development and implementation of novel methods and algorithms. He has been a contributor to many open source projects, most notably the RDKit. His current role at Cresset involves scientific development of the company codebase and technical customer support.*

***Lightning Talks***

- *<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mihaela Smilova</span> (SGC):*  “**Fragment Hotspot Maps to Drive the Elaboration of Fragment Screening Hits**“; and
- *<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr Tomasz Piskorz</span> (Department of Chemistry):* “**A Short Intro to** [**MDAnalysis**](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) **(A Python Tool to Analyze the Results of MD simulations**)”.

Refreshments will be provided, including **beer**.

We would like to thank the University of Oxford [MPLS Network and Interdisciplinary Fund](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/news/nif) (NIF) for making CCK possible.

## **Want to speak? Ideas for speakers?**

If you have ideas for speakers, or would like to give a talk, **[get in touch](mailto:garrett.morris@stats.ox.ac.uk)**. We also invite lightning talks of 5 minutes (or fewer) from attendees, so if you have some cool code you’ve been working on and would like to demo it, bring your laptop, smartphone, tablet, (wearable?) and tell us all about it.

The talks usually resemble one of the following styles:

- an overview of computational chemistry in your research;
- a (live!) demonstration of some software that you are developing or using; or
- a summary of a computational chemistry paper, method, programming language, or tool that you’ve seen recently.

Please pass this announcement on to friends, colleagues, and students who may be interested too!

## About CCK

Comp Chem Kitchen is a regular forum and seminar series to hear about and discuss computational methods for tackling problems in chemistry, biochemistry and drug discovery. It focuses principally on cheminformatics, computational chemistry, and molecular modelling, and overlaps with neighboring areas such as materials properties and bioinformatics.

We’re keen to encourage people involved in coding and methods development (*i.e.* hackers, in the original [untarnished sense](http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06/hackers-at-25.html) of the word) to join us. Our hope is that we will share best practices, even code snippets and software tools, and avoid re-inventing wheels.

In addition to local researchers, we invite speakers from industry and non-profits from time to time, and occasionally organize software demos and tutorials.

If you’re interested in giving a talk, here are some possible topics:

- Software development (*e.g.*: Python, C, C++, CUDA, shell, Matlab);
- Optimizing force field parameters &amp; EVB models;
- Cheminformatics (*e.g.*: RDKit);
- X-ray and NMR crystallography, including small molecule and macromolecular;
- Protein &amp; RNA modeling, including Molecular Dynamics;
- Virtual screening and Docking;
- Machine Learning;
- Quantum Methods, including DFT.

**Bring your laptops, by the way, if you have something you’d like to show!**

See you soon! We’re looking forward to seeing and hearing about the diverse range of computational molecular science that you’re cooking up…
